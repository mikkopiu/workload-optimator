# workload-optimator

Workload optimizing for courses. Built in JavaScript (ES6, transpiled to ES5 with [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/)) as coursework in Metropolia UAS.
The app uses Web Workers to run its calculations, away from the main thread.

`dist` contains the transpiled resources, ready for deployment, and `src` the ES6 and Less sources.
